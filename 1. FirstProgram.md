### 5. Conceptual Overview — ns-3 Tutorial
#### 5.1. Key Abstractions
1. **Node**:
   - In Internet jargon, a computing device that connects to a network is called a host or sometimes an end system. Because ns-3 is a  network simulator, not specifically an Internet simulator  we intentionally do not use the term host since it is closely associated with the Internet and its protocols. Instead, we use a more generic term also used by other simulators that originates in Graph Theory — the node.
   - Acts like a generic computer, to which you add applications, protocol stacks, and devices.
   - Equivalent to a "host" but more generic (not specific to the Internet).

2. **Application**:-
   - Computer software is divided into two broad classes. System Software organizes various computer resources such as memory, processor cycles, disk, network, etc.,
   - Simulated user-level applications in ns-3, represented by the `Application` class.
   - Applications run on `Nodes` to simulate network activities, similar to how real-world software runs on a computer.
   - Specializations: `UdpEchoClientApplication`, `UdpEchoServerApplication`.

3. **Channel**:
   - A communication medium connecting nodes, represented by the `Channel` class.
   - Specialized versions: `CsmaChannel`, `PointToPointChannel`, `WifiChannel`.
   - Models a medium as simple as a wire or as complex as wireless environments.

4. **Net Device**:
   - Represents both software drivers and hardware-like network interfaces in ns-3 (`NetDevice` class).
   - Acts as a simulated NIC, connecting nodes to channels.
   - Specialized versions: `CsmaNetDevice`, `PointToPointNetDevice`, `WifiNetDevice`.

5. **Topology Helpers**:
   - Helper classes to simplify network setup and configuration.
   - Examples: `NodeContainer`, `InternetStackHelper`, `Ipv4AddressHelper`.
   - Automate repetitive tasks like connecting `NetDevices`, assigning IPs, etc.

#### 5.2. A First ns-3 Script
1. **Directory Structure**:
   - The main ns-3 directory has subdirectories for source code (`src`), examples (`examples`), and documentation.
   - `first.cc`: A basic script in `examples/tutorial` showing a point-to-point connection.

2. **Module Includes**:
   - Grouped by functionality (e.g., `core-module.h`, `network-module.h`).
   - Modules help manage include dependencies easily.

3. **Namespaces**:
   - All ns-3 related code resides in the `ns3` namespace to avoid conflicts.
   - Use `using namespace ns3;` to simplify code.

4. **Logging**:
   - `NS_LOG_COMPONENT_DEFINE`: Defines a logging component for debugging.
   - Logging levels can be set using `LogComponentEnable`.

#### 5.2.1 - 5.2.5. Code Structure Overview
1. **Main Function**:
   - The `main` function is the entry point.
   - Typical setup includes setting time resolution (`Time::SetResolution`) and enabling logging.

2. **Topology Helpers**:
   - **NodeContainer**: Creates and manages nodes.
   - **PointToPointHelper**: Configures and installs point-to-point devices/channels.
   - **NetDeviceContainer**: Stores created network devices.

3. **Internet Stack**:
   - `InternetStackHelper`: Installs TCP/IP stack on nodes.
   - `Ipv4AddressHelper`: Assigns IP addresses to `NetDevices`.

4. **Applications**:
   - Specializations like `UdpEchoServerHelper` and `UdpEchoClientHelper`.
   - Server and client apps are installed on nodes to generate traffic.

5. **Running Simulation**:
   - Use `Simulator::Run()` to start the simulation and `Simulator::Destroy()` to clean up.
   - Events are executed in temporal order.

#### 5.2.6. Topology Setup
1. **Node Setup**:
   - Use `NodeContainer` to create and manage nodes.
   - Connect nodes with `PointToPointHelper`, configuring attributes like data rate and delay.

2. **Net Devices & Channels**:
   - Devices are created with `Install()` methods from helper objects.
   - Attributes are set for devices (e.g., `"DataRate"`) and channels (e.g., `"Delay"`).

3. **Protocol Stack**:
   - Use `InternetStackHelper` to install TCP/IP stacks on nodes.
   - Use `Ipv4AddressHelper` to manage and assign IP addresses.

#### 5.2.7. Applications
1. **Server Application**:
   - Use `UdpEchoServerHelper` to set up a server.
   - Specify parameters like port and duration (e.g., Start/Stop times).

2. **Client Application**:
   - Use `UdpEchoClientHelper` to set up a client.
   - Configure attributes like target address, number of packets (`MaxPackets`), and packet size.

#### 5.2.8. Simulation Execution
1. **Simulation Workflow**:
   - Schedule events using `Start` and `Stop` methods.
   - `Simulator::Run()` executes events in order; `Simulator::Destroy()` cleans up.

2. **Stop Criteria**:
   - Simulations end when the event queue is empty or when `Simulator::Stop()` is called.

#### 5.2.9. Building Scripts
1. **Script Building**:
   - Place scripts in the `scratch` directory for easy compilation.
   - Use `./ns3 run scratch/myfirst` to execute the script.

2. **Output Verification**:
   - Example output includes logs indicating sent and received packets, demonstrating successful simulation.

### 5.3. Ns-3 Source Code
1. **Directory Structure**:
   - Core source files: Located in `src/core`.
   - Application helpers: Located in `src/applications/helper`.

2. **Source Exploration**:
   - Feel free to navigate the `src` directory to get a better understanding of ns-3’s codebase structure and style.
